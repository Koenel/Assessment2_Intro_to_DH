## Introduction to Digital Humanities, Assessment 2, Data sources
This project is part of an assessment for the course MA Digital Humanities at King's College London, 2020/2021.
You can find the datasets used for my project for Assessment 2 in this folder. The ArcGIS StoryMaps site has been created with the help of this data and can be used to recreate a similar project or expand on the current one.

## Here is the link to the ArcGIS StoryMap: https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/4b72849e1d3f4f5f8edc9f0b58d2e5e5

Please go to www.sammlungenonline.albertina.at/ to retrieve information about the posters if you would like to create your own dataset. I have taken down the pictures from the ArcGIS StoryMaps site before it went live, so that it would not violate copyright. You can view the picture in the albertina collection, following the permalinks.
Please note that I do not own any rights to the posters or their digitisations. Maps and visualisations on ArcGIS StoryMaps are my own creation.
